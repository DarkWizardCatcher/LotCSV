"cloudflare","Attackers are exploiting Cloudflare Workers, Cloudflare Tunnels, and Cloudflare Apps to establish resilient Command-and-Control (C2) infrastructures. By routing malicious traffic through Cloudflare’s network, they can blend in with legitimate traffic, making detection more difficult. Rather than directly exposing their C2 servers, they leverage Cloudflare as a proxy, complicating efforts to track and block their infrastructure. This technique enables attackers to host payloads, relay commands, and exfiltrate data while benefiting from Cloudflare’s security and reliability.","[''https://github.com/ChoiSG/CloudflarePagesRedirector''-|-''https://github.com/som3canadian/Cloudflare-Redirector''-|-''https://github.com/nickvourd/SkyFall-Pack'']","[''Cloudflare Tunnels: *.cfargotunnel.com''-|-''Cloudflare Workers and Apps: https://*.workers.dev''-|-''Cloudfare Pages: https://*.pages.dev''-|-''Cloudflare DoH: https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query''-|-''blog: https://labs.jumpsec.com/putting-the-c2-in-c2loudflare/''-|-''comment: Keep an eye on DNS queries for subdomains of cfargotunnel.com and workers.dev that don't align with normal business operations''-|-''[CloudflarePagesRedirector] In this project the default user-agents strings ('ligoloua' & 'sliverua') serve as identifiers for implants to communicate with their respective backends'']","false"

"whatsapp","Attackers can exploit WhatsApp’s XMPP-based messaging protocol and media transfer APIs to create a covert command-and-control (C2) channel, enabling bi-directional communication with infected devices. This allows adversaries to send remote commands, receive execution results, and exfiltrate stolen data, all while camouflaging malicious traffic as normal WhatsApp activity. By automating interactions through unofficial APIs like **Yowsup** (used by the project whatsappcli) or abusing WhatsApp Web library like whatsapp-web.js, attackers can establish a stealthy C2 framework that operates within encrypted message exchanges, making detection difficult. Commands can be embedded in incoming WhatsApp messages, instructing the execution tasks such as file exfiltration, keylogging, or persistence mechanisms, with execution results sent back via outbound messages or media transfers. Attackers can leverage WhatsApp’s media servers (mms.whatsapp.net) to exfiltrate sensitive data, disguising payloads as legitimate file-sharing activity.","[''https://github.com/KarimJedda/whatsappcli'']","[''HTTP - POST url: https://v.whatsapp.net/v2/register''-|-''HTTP - POST url: https://v.whatsapp.net/v2/exist''-|-''XMPP - connection and messaging routing: c.whatsapp.net - s.whatsapp.net - e1.whatsapp.net - e2.whatsapp.net - e3.whatsapp.net - e4.whatsapp.net - e5.whatsapp.net - e6.whatsapp.net - e7.whatsapp.net - e8.whatsapp.net - e9.whatsapp.net - e10.whatsapp.net - e11.whatsapp.net - e12.whatsapp.net - e13.whatsapp.net - e14.whatsapp.net - e15.whatsapp.net - e16.whatsapp.net''-|-''XMPP - Media server for image/file transfers: mms.whatsapp.net''-|-''Detection logic: Unusual XMPP traffic to c.whatsapp.net and eX.whatsapp.net from a non-mobile device''-|-''Detection logic: Unusual volume of inbound/outbound XMPP traffic''-|-''Detection logic: Excessive outbound media uploads to mms.whatsapp.net''-|-''Detection logic: Presence of Yowsup or whatsapp-web.js automation scripts on a system'']","false"
