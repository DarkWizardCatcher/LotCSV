This project aims to streamline work of detection engineers and threat hunters. It's purpose is to gather different data sources from Living off the Land oprojects and gathers them into .csv files to easily work with them inside various security tools like SIEM. There is feature which adds "is_legit" column. Cou can use it while filtering lines by setting true or false values. 

You can check how exported .csv files look in [directory](https://github.com/DarkWizardCatcher/LotCSV/tree/main/export)
